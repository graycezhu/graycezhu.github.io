   Manhattan is the most densely populated of New York City’s 5 boroughs. 
   It's mostly made up of Manhattan Island, bounded by the Hudson, East and Harlem rivers. 
   Among the world’s major commercial, financial and cultural centers, it’s the heart of “the Big Apple.” 
   Its iconic sites include skyscrapers such as the Empire State Building, neon-lit Times Square and the theaters of Broadway.
